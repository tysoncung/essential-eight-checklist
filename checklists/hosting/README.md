## How to Use These Checklists

### 1. Select Your Platform
Choose the checklist that matches your hosting environment. If you use multiple platforms, review each relevant checklist.

### 2. Assess Current State
Go through each item and mark your current compliance level:
- ‚úÖ Implemented
- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚ùå Not Started
- N/A Not Applicable

### 3. Prioritize Implementation
Each checklist includes implementation phases:
- **Phase 1**: Critical security controls (Immediate)
- **Phase 2**: High priority items (30 days)
- **Phase 3**: Medium priority items (90 days)
- **Phase 4**: Ongoing improvements

### 4. Map to Maturity Levels
All checklists are organized by Essential Eight Maturity Levels:
- **ML1**: Basic cyber hygiene
- **ML2**: Enhanced security posture
- **ML3**: Advanced protection against sophisticated threats

## Common Security Controls Across All Platforms

### Essential Eight Controls
1. **Application Control** - Whitelisting and execution control
2. **Patch Applications** - Regular security updates
3. **Configure Office Macros** - Restrict macro execution
4. **User Application Hardening** - Browser and application security
5. **Restrict Admin Privileges** - Least privilege access
6. **Patch Operating Systems** - OS security updates
7. **Multi-factor Authentication** - Strong authentication
8. **Regular Backups** - Data protection and recovery

### Additional Security Layers
- Network segmentation
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Security monitoring and SIEM
- Incident response planning
- Compliance management
- Vulnerability management
- Security awareness training

## Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Considerations

If you're using multiple platforms:

1. **Consistent Security Policies**
   - Standardize security controls across platforms
   - Use cloud-agnostic tools where possible
   - Maintain unified compliance reporting

2. **Centralized Management**
   - Consider CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) tools
   - Implement unified SIEM/SOAR
   - Centralize identity management

3. **Network Connectivity**
   - Secure interconnections between platforms
   - Consistent network security policies
   - Unified threat detection

## Automation and Infrastructure as Code

Each checklist includes automation examples:
- **On-Premise**: PowerShell, Ansible, Puppet
- **AWS**: CloudFormation, Terraform, AWS CLI
- **Azure**: ARM Templates, Terraform, Azure CLI
- **GCP**: Deployment Manager, Terraform, gcloud

## Compliance and Regulatory Alignment

All checklists align with:
- Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Controls
- ISO 27001/27002
- Industry-specific requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.)

## Regular Review and Updates

Security is an ongoing process:
1. Review checklists quarterly
2. Update based on new threats
3. Incorporate platform updates
4. Adjust for compliance changes
5. Learn from security incidents
